      <h3>Creating a Safe Place</h3>
      <p>
        Create a space that is safe for kids to reflect on their emotional
        responses to the recent tragic events. Start by asking what they’ve
        heard. Focus on themes they understand, such as fairness and empathy.
        You can point out that George Floyd was not treated fairly and in our
        school/family, we believe everyone should be treated fairly. It’s okay
        not to have all the answers. But it’s important to recognize that
        upsetting events are happening and this is a safe space to talk about
        it, listen to one another, and learn how we can change things. For more
        ideas on how to create a safe space for reflection, see Facing History
        and Ourselves.

      <h3>Talking About Race and Racial Identity</h3>
      <p>
        Children, like adults, see skin color. Even from a young age, they’re
        aware of these kinds of differences. It’s essential to acknowledge race
        even if you think it doesn’t impact your family because it does, in
        fact, affect everyone. When we discuss identity—and encourage kids to
        take pride in who they are and respect the differences in others—we
        empower them to stand up to racial injustice. Talking about these issues
        with children also allows us to show how they can disrupt inequality and
        combat systemic racism. Talking about race is not racist. It’s
        important!
      </p>

      <h3>Being Antiracist</h3>
      <p>
        “Black Lives Matter” doesn’t mean that only Black lives matter. It means
        that racism unfairly affects Black lives—the Black Lives Matter movement
        is calling on everyone to change that. Even if the intention is sincere,
        help your child understand that the phrase “All Lives Matter” implies
        that the BLM movement’s critique of systemic racism and its effects on
        Black people is invalid. For more teacher support on this topic, see
        Dena Simmons’ article, How to Be an Antiracist Educator. For more family
        support, read “6 Reasons ‘All Lives Matter’ Doesn’t Work—in Terms Simple
        Enough for a Child” from Parents.com. Racial colorblindness is the idea
        that NOT seeing color is a good thing; that race shouldn’t matter. But,
        in fact, it does the opposite. When we don’t recognize race, we
        perpetuate racial misunderstandings and we erase the specific lived
        experience of those affected by racism. For a truly antiracist society
        to exist one day, it’s essential to be aware of and talk about race. We
        can’t afford to be silent.

      <h3>Giving Young People Hope and Empowering Them to Speak Up</h3>
      <p>
        Acknowledge kids’ anxieties and fear, but also reassure them that many
        people are working very hard to change things and keep them safe. It’s
        important to give children hope. We can give them hope by offering tools
        to work with. Explain that mass protest movements—from Civil Rights and
        Women’s Suffrage to Black Lives Matter—have historically been able to
        change institutions and systems. Assure them that society can continue
        to improve. Empower young people by encouraging them to use their voice
        and actions to participate and make a difference. They can stand up for
        their friends and classmates, write letters, and engage in adult-guided
        activities—like fundraisers.
