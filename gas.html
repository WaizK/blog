      <h1>Gas Prices</h1>
      <h3>How Gas Prices Are Raising</h3>
      <p>
        Despite Canadians in the country’s interior noticing lower prices than
        their coastal counterparts, the price of crude oil is currently trading
        for just over US$93 a barrel, Dr. Werner Antweiler, economics professor
        at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder’s School of Business,
        told Global News.

        This is the highest it’s been since 2014, he noted. With high demand and
        low supply, the concern of Russia, a major supplier of oil, curtailing
        shipments in response to imposed sanctions because of its ongoing clash
        with Ukraine, doesn’t make things any better.

      <h2>What Is The Cost Of Gas</h2>
      <p>
        When buying a gallon of gas, the money goes towards the cost of the
        crude oil, refining, distribution and marketing, and taxes. The cost of
        crude oil accounts for more than half of what the consumer pays for at
        gas stations. However, this wasn’t the case during the first few months
        of the pandemic when the cost of crude oil dropped to just 25% of what
        the consumer paid.

      <h2>Why are gas prices so high?</h2>
      <p>
        The rising gas prices in 2021 are due to the increased demand for crude
        oil after significantly dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic. As summer
        2021 approached, gas prices were expected to increase as peak travel
        season came back. However, a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline
        on May 7 forced the company to halt all operations, thus starting a fuel
        shortage that was impacted by both the supply chain and by consumers.
        After six days of being offline, pipeline operations resumed on May 12
        but the national average for gas prices still surpassed $3 with over
        10,000 gas stations out of gas after panic buying and delayed
        distributions. The cyber attack caused gas prices to jump up sooner than
        expected, and it has remained above the $3 mark past the Fourth of July.
