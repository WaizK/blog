      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p >    

  The Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) is an independent association comprising Alberta’s 69 counties and municipal districts. Since 1909, we have helped rural municipalities achieve strong, effective, local government. RMA provides Advocacy and Business Services (including RMA Trade, RMA Fuel, and RMA Insurance).
  RMA’s strategic plan sets goals to meet our members’ diverse needs, while our annual reports keep us accountable to our members. Download the RMA 2019 – 2023 Strategic Plan.
  You can also download our Association Bylaws (as of November 2021).
